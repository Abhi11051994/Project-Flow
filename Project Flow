In my current project, I am working with a retail client, and the data is sourced from multiple platforms. Primarily, I handle transaction data, product data, customer data, and social media data. This data is available in both structured and unstructured formats.

The unstructured data primarily comes from social media and customer data, which is available in JSON and text formats. The structured data is retrieved from Oracle and SQL Server databases. The SQL Server database contains complete transaction information, while the Oracle server stores product and regional-level data. Both servers are hosted locally rather than on the cloud.

My task is to migrate this data from local servers to the cloud. We began by collecting the data from all sources using Azure Data Factory. Since the data is local, I utilized the Copy Data activity to extract it. The data was then moved into two destinations: Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2).

The dataset contained several issues, such as null values, duplicate records, and required label encoding. To address this, we used Azure Databricks to connect to both data sources and implemented all the necessary business transformations as per the client's requirements. The transformations were structured using the Medallion Architecture, consisting of Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers. Each layer was processed using separate Jupyter notebooks.

In the Bronze layer, we focused on activities like reading datasets, schema validation, and consistency checks.
In the Silver layer, we performed transformations, such as creating new columns, dropping unnecessary columns, filling null values, and executing other preprocessing steps.
In the Gold layer, we performed aggregations to generate data in formats that were useful for end users and cross-functional teams.
After the aggregation process, we pushed the data from the Gold layer into ADLS Gen2. Additionally, we conducted data validation, unit testing, and other tests to ensure the accuracy of the transformations.
